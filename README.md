CryptoKitties
+
The frontend gives the user an option to make the cats the cats breeding. The smart contract will use the parents DNA to create a new unic cat. Do you want to include an oracle functionality with a random variable to give the cats Rare capabilities ? it will be nice to introduce this concept which is not in the original cryptokitties app We will also have to setup the cat cooldown.

let instance = await Kittycontract.deployed()

instance.name()
